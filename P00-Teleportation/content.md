In this tutorial, we’re going to implement a teleportation mechanic for a VR puzzle game in which the player can teleport onto any surface to change the direction of gravity for certain objects. The objective of each level will be to move all weighted Tokens to the Goal.

VR doesn’t have very many standards yet, but one that is becoming popular is teleportation. We encourage you, for your own projects, to try and think of a more creative alternative, but we do think it’s useful to learn how to implement teleportation in case you ever want to use it.

In this tutorial, we’ll implement:

-   A player that can launch out a beam and teleport onto surfaces!

-   Non-teleportable and teleportable surfaces

-   A screen effect to mask the actual teleport

If you’d like to go on after the basic tutorial, we’ll also show you how to make:

-   Beam-bouncing surfaces, like mirrors

-   Beam-bending objects, like prisms!
